# mongodb-dapi

This is a simple package for Mongodbs data api. Originally built for a cloudflare worker project I was working on.

If there is a global fetch function install with `--no-optional` as a parameter.

Note: This is my first typescript package as well as my first npm package so the first 2 versions are broken and I am sorry for that.
